Nengo for circuit modeling
Neuron, synapse, and dendrites


Neuromorphic
Neurons -> channel models (transistors)

This project will be centered on the field of neuromorphic computing, with particular emphasis placed on the development and implementation of neuron circuit modeling. The work will make use of the Python package Nengo, a tool specifically designed for modeling neural systems. The project aims to construct detailed and systematic simulations that replicate the behavior and dynamics of biological neurons in a computational environment. The focus will remain on leveraging Nengoâ€™s capabilities to explore and represent neural processes in a structured and precise manner, so that the simulations align with the broader goals of neuromorphic research. As far as deliverables are concerned, I plan to present my research at the GT Europe Research fair at the end of the semester.

1. The Ensemble contains a group of neurons that encodes a
time-varying vector of real numbers.
2. The Node represents non-neural information, such as sensory
inputs and motor outputs.
3. The Connection describes how nodes and ensembles are
connected.
4. The Probe gathers data during a simulation for later analysis.
5. The Network encapsulates a functionally related group of
interconnected nodes and ensembles.
6. The Model encapsulates a Nengo model.
